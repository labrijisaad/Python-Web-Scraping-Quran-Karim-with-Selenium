- 🎯 In this notebook, I tried to write a script capable of **`scraping the Quran Karim in different languages (French, English and Wolof) to have parallel data`**.
- 🛠️ The procedure and how the scraping is done, as well as the cleaning is explained in the notebooks.
  - There are 3 notebooks in total, each notebook is dedicated to Quran scrapping in **`French`**, **`English`** and **`Wolof`**.
